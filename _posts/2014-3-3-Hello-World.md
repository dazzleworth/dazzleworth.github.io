About Me

Four things that define my life. Creativity. Travel. Fitness. Nature. I have two cats and I code. Very familiar with C/C++, C#, Java, PHP and Python. 

This site is my programming journal as I explore the intracies of software development that I would like to share with the world.

Feel free to browse around my code [repository](https://github.com/dazzleworth)
